# BehaviorNeuroLink: Neural Activity and Behavior Analysis Toolkit

BehaviorNeuroLink is a Python package for analyzing the relationship between neural activity and behavior using multiple linear regression. It provides a  suite of tools for preprocessing calcium imaging data, constructing regression models, and interpreting the encoding of behavioral information in neural signals.

## Key Features:

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Downsampling of calcium imaging time-series data
  - Design matrix construction for behavioral variables

- **Multicollinear Diagnostics**: 
  - Tools to assess and address multicollinearity in behavioral predictors

- **Neural Encoding Analysis**: 
  - Linear regression-based encoding models to relate neural activity to behavioral variables
  - Time kernel incorporation to account for temporal dynamics in neural responses

## Who Should Use BehavioralNeuralRegressor:

- Neuroscientists studying the neural basis of behavior
- Researchers working with calcium imaging or fiber photometry data
